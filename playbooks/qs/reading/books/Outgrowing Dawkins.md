We’re just an accidental blip on the face of the cosmos. But that can’t be quite right. It does seem that it is quite natural for galaxies to form. It is natural for some stars to explode into supernovas and to produce heavier elements. It is natural for planets to form and most scientists say that, sooner or later, given the right conditions, life will emerge and then, given the Darwinian principles of selection, intelligence is likely to be favoured. So the scientific conclusion from all that seems to be that the universe is, as the British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees puts it, both biophilic and noophilic, that is to say that it will tend in due course to produce life and intelligence. There is a natural tendency there, if you like, so using words like ‘accident,’ ‘random,’ and so on is in a way misleading.29 — location: [654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081NGMK3W&location=654) ^ref-44092
