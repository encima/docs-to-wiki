## Highlights
Look, for both you and me, at the very depths of our souls, there drifts the repulsively putrid stink of immorality! You preach on what is moral to immoral people. I am seeking morality. This truly is intervention, nothing less than force. The things you say are full of contradictions. I’ll say it again: your idealism will have no effect at all in an actual situation. — location: [484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=484) ^ref-25564

Can you throw yourself into the bottomless darkness? This is not such an easy thing to talk about. That is why people do not try to change and why they want to feel okay with things as they are, no matter how tough life gets. And they end up living in search of ‘okay as I am’ ingredients in order to affirm their current situation. — location: [743](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=743) ^ref-47139

The gateway of education is respect. And respect is confidence. Therefore, a relationship based on confidence is a friend relationship. It’s that sort of syllogism, right? — location: [2274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2274) ^ref-55980

Mother Teresa, on being asked ‘What can you do to promote world peace?’, gave the following reply: ‘Go home and love your family.’ It is the same with Adler’s community feeling. Instead of doing something for world peace, just have confidence in the person in front of you. Become comrades with that person in front of you. That everyday, small accumulation of confidence will some day get rid of even conflict between nations. — location: [2493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2493) ^ref-51770

‘Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: you should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.’ — location: [2502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2502) ^ref-43227

This is a condition in which one has secured some guarantee of being loved, even if it is all one’s own misunderstanding. One feels some kind of collateral there: ‘That person probably likes me,’ or ‘They probably won’t reject my goodwill.’ And it is on the basis of that collateral that we can begin to love more deeply. — location: [2973](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2973) ^ref-25958

One must not seek collateral in love. — location: [2978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=2978) ^ref-12975

Suppose, for example, a person who says ‘I like flowers’, but lets them wither right away. This person forgets to water them, doesn’t think of transplanting them into a different pot or adjusting the amount of light, and just puts the flowerpot in a place where they look nice. To be sure, it may be true that the person likes looking at flowers. But one could not say that this person loves flowers. Love is a more dedicated approach. — location: [3125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KQQTVKD&location=3125) ^ref-42419
