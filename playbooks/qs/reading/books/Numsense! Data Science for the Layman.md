## Highlights
However, if the original dataset is small, we may not have the luxury of setting aside data to form a test dataset, because we may sacrifice accuracy when the amount of data used to train our model is reduced. Hence, instead of using two separate datasets for training and testing, cross-validation would allow us to use one dataset for both purposes. â€” location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N29ZEM6&location=259) ^ref-33172
