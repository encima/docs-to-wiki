## Highlights
An autistic person may constantly change their image (‘which mask should I wear today?’). In doing so, they may have developed a lack of self-identity caused by years of masking. This may have led to a misunderstanding of who they are, which can result in not having a sense of self or purpose. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084X7NLG7&location=388) ^ref-29076

When a child or adult typically does well at school or in their workplace with no issues, but then explodes into disruptive meltdowns or raging anger once home in their ‘safe space’, it is a huge sign that they have been masking for the duration of the day. The energy it takes to mask and ‘fit in’ can be mentally and physically exhausting. — location: [428](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084X7NLG7&location=428) ^ref-62185

---
They may recognise in themselves that they are socially different/inept (may feel embarrassed about showing their true self). — location: [463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084X7NLG7&location=463) ^ref-1977

---
They may be fascinated with non-autistic ‘social norms’, analysing and observing the way non-autistic peers interact and communicate, wanting to learn how to do it themselves. — location: [468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084X7NLG7&location=468) ^ref-1668

The mask also acts as a coping strategy when anxieties are in a heightened state, by creating stability and control when they are feeling uneasy and dysfunctional. It also assists with predictability, for example, when anticipating social events, how to act, behave, interact, etc., (they can practice social scripts prior to the event).   Masking can naturally be triggered when wanting to search for a companion. For many autistic adults, without the mask, they would have had major difficulties when pursuing or forming a relationship with a love interest. — location: [507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084X7NLG7&location=507) ^ref-51126

For example, if a person was to mask for the first six months of a relationship but then changed character when they felt comfortable, this could impact the social connection that had formerly developed, hindering the relationship. The love interest may become confused by the autistic person’s behaviour, making statements such as, ‘You’ve changed’ or, ‘Why can’t you be the person I met six months ago?’ — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084X7NLG7&location=514) ^ref-39646

It’s common to hear autistic people being accused of ‘acting autistic’ by family and friends. This is because they have spent years trying their hardest to hide their difficulties, but when they can no longer keep up the mask, people pick up on the difference and don’t take their ASD diagnosis seriously. All these negative reactions can be very damaging for the autistic individual and can exacerbate feelings of not belonging. Many people in society struggle to grasp the concept that an autistic person can go to college, work, get married, have a family, be intelligent, be successful, and maintain friendships and relationships. What these people are not understanding is the effort it takes for autistic people to do this, and the coping strategies that are put in place to enable them to live effectively, not realising the detrimental impact from years of keeping up this ‘social persona’ can have on them mentally, physically and emotionally. This is why we see so many autistic adults with severe mental health issues. — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084X7NLG7&location=594) ^ref-29882
