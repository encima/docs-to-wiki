## Highlights
Nothing ever stops at the quarterly win. There are four quarters to a year. Forty to a decade. Every one of them has to produce, exceed, and beat EXPECTATIONS. Why would you do that to yourself and your business? Doing great, creative work is hard enough. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FQYGWCS&location=301) ^ref-63704

So we borrowed an idea from academia: office hours. All subject-matter experts at Basecamp now publish office hours. For some that means an open afternoon every Tuesday. For others it might be one hour a day. It’s up to each expert to decide their availability. But what if you have a question on Monday and someone’s office hours aren’t until Thursday? You wait, that’s what you do. You work on something else until Thursday, or you figure it out for yourself before Thursday. — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FQYGWCS&location=503) ^ref-48295

When you optimize people’s calendars for effortless carving, you shouldn’t be surprised when people’s time is sliced up. Furthermore, if you make it easy for someone to invite five other people to a meeting—because software can find the open slot that works for everyone—then meetings with six people will proliferate. — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FQYGWCS&location=524) ^ref-2139

If you don’t own the vast majority of your own time, it’s impossible to be calm. You’ll always be stressed out, feeling robbed of the ability to actually do your job. — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FQYGWCS&location=532) ^ref-25211

Previously, we had been sending users a single email when they signed up and nothing much after that. So we imagined that sending more emails over time would quickly move the conversion numbers north. It didn’t. What looked like low-hanging fruit was neither ripe nor within reach. — location: [720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FQYGWCS&location=720) ^ref-8786

Following group chat at work is like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda. It’s completely exhausting. — location: [1023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FQYGWCS&location=1023) ^ref-54917

Time-management hacks, life hacks, sleep hacks, work hacks. These all reflect an obsession with trying to squeeze more time out of the day, but rearranging your daily patterns to find more time for work isn’t the problem. Too much shit to do is the problem. The only way to get more done is to have less to do. — location: [1340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FQYGWCS&location=1340) ^ref-13025

When someone copies you, they are copying a moment in time. They don’t know the thinking that went into getting you to that moment in time, and they won’t know the thinking that’ll help you have a million more moments in time. They’re stuck with what you left behind. So, really, chill out. Accept the mild frustration for a moment and then let it go. — location: [1560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FQYGWCS&location=1560) ^ref-42570

Jean-Louis Gassée, who used to run Apple France, describes this situation as the choice between two tokens. When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to take the token that says “It’s no big deal” or the token that says “It’s the end of the world.” Whichever token you pick, they’ll take the other. — location: [1616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FQYGWCS&location=1616) ^ref-39820
