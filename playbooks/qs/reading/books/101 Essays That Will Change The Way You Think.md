## Highlights
“The last one hundred years of research suggest that you, and everyone else, still believe in a form of naïve realism. You still believe that although your inputs may not be perfect, once you get to thinking and feeling, those thoughts and feelings are reliable and predictable. We now know that there is no way you can ever know an “objective” reality, and we know that you can never know how much of subjective reality is a fabrication, because you never experience anything other than the output of your mind. Everything that’s ever happened to you has happened inside your skull.” — location: [999](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MYMUGQL&location=999) ^ref-23821

They do not use logic to deny their emotions. They validate their feelings by acknowledging them; they do not say someone “shouldn’t” feel a particular way if they do. — location: [1044](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MYMUGQL&location=1044) ^ref-44909

Learn the difference between honesty and truth. The way you honestly feel can be different from how you truthfully feel—the former is usually temporary, the latter is deeper, and consistent. — location: [1268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MYMUGQL&location=1268) ^ref-48274

Fire can burn your house down, or it can cook you dinner each night and keep you warm in the winter. Your mind is the same way. — location: [1274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MYMUGQL&location=1274) ^ref-59003

Recognize that anxiety stems from shame. It is the idea that who you are or what you are doing is “not right,” therefore eliciting a rush of energy designed to help you “fix” or change it. You’re suffering because there’s nothing you can fix to make that urgent, panicked feeling go away. It’s a mismanaged perception of who and how you are. — location: [1277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MYMUGQL&location=1277) ^ref-43667

Fall in love with the unknown, for the fact that it will almost always bring you things better than you could have imagined—things that are worse than you could have imagined are almost always products of your own thinking or perception of what they mean about you or your future. — location: [1334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MYMUGQL&location=1334) ^ref-2475

---
Practice radical acceptance. Learn to tell the parts of your story you’d rather shove under the rug. — location: [1336](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MYMUGQL&location=1336) ^ref-39854
