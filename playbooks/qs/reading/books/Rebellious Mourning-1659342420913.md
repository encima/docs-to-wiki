## Highlights
We often avoid mourning because we believe we do not have the luxury to breakdown, to stop and really feel. I suggest we need to recognize both when sadness is keeping us from moving and when the urgency of movement is blocking our need to feel grief. â€” location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CMMMF4&location=249) ^ref-38841
