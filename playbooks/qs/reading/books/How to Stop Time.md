## Highlights
That’s the thing with time, isn’t it? It’s not all the same. Some days – some years – some decades – are empty. There is nothing to them. It’s just flat water. And then you come across a year, or even a day, or an afternoon. And it is everything. It is the whole thing.’ — location: [3742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N9PVQE4&location=3742) ^ref-19272
