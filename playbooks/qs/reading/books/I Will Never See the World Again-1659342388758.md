## Highlights
As someone who has been thrown into the dirty, swelling waves of reality, I can say with certainty that its victims are those so-called smart people who believe that you have to act in accordance with it. — location: [145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PFYBMB5&location=145) ^ref-46013

That humankind can conceive that so dreadful a place was created by a force representing ‘absolute goodness’ and that, despite the violence at the foundations of their being, they still possess such an optimistic imagination seems to me the strangest of human paradoxes. They believe all this was created by a ‘force’, yet they don’t reproach that ‘force’. On the contrary, they worship it with gratitude. Religion, as the consequence of people’s ability to see ‘goodness’ in this terrifying planet of ours, has interested me ever since I was young. God is a magnificent metaphor. — location: [912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PFYBMB5&location=912) ^ref-36319
