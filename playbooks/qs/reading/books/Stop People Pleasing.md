## Highlights
She believes her husband is doing her a favor just by staying with her, and she fears that her children might discover she’s not a good enough mother for them.   To compensate for her insecurity and feelings of worthlessness, she gives them all her time and service while disregarding her own needs. She considers herself worth their love only so far as they are pleased with how she behaves. — location: [476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07GM1PBP4&location=476) ^ref-59966
