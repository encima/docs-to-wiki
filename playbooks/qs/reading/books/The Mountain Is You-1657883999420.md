## Highlights
In reality, self-sabotage is simply the presence of an unconscious need that is being fulfilled by the self-sabotaging behavior. To overcome this, we must go through a process of deep psychological excavation. We must pinpoint the traumatic event, release unprocessed emotions, find healthier ways to meet our needs, reinvent our self-image, and develop principles such as emotional intelligence and resilience.

In the end, self-sabotage is very often just a maladaptive coping mechanism, a way we give ourselves what we need without having to actually address what that need is. — location: [114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=114) ^ref-55860

Maybe you keep eating the wrong foods because they soothe you, but you haven’t stopped to ask what they have to keep soothing you from. — location: [149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=149) ^ref-29311

One of the biggest reasons that people avoid doing important internal work is that they recognize if they heal themselves, their lives will change—sometimes drastically. If they come to terms with how unhappy they are, it means that they will have to temporarily be more uncomfortable, ashamed, or scared while they start all over. — location: [246](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=246) ^ref-40323

In uprooting, you are not allowing yourself to blossom; you are only comfortable with the process of sprouting. — location: [348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=348) ^ref-40667

---
an inability to process your emotions means you get stuck with them. You sit and dwell on your anger and sadness because you don’t know how to make them go away. When we can only process half of our emotions, we ultimately only live half of the life we really want to. — location: [387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=387) ^ref-9103

Many people say that you have to love yourself first before you can love others, but really, if you learn to love others, you will learn to love yourself. — location: [466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=466) ^ref-51619

Nobody is “busy” unless they want to be busy, and you will know that because so many people with extremely hectic schedules would never describe themselves that way. — location: [554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=554) ^ref-63457

Your willpower is a limited resource. You only have so much in a day. Rather than using it to try to become good at everything, decide what matters most to you. Focus your attention on that, and let everything else slip away. — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=634) ^ref-44874

The way you are self-sabotaging: Pushing people away. What your subconscious mind might want you to know: You want people to love and accept you so much that the stress of it all makes you isolate yourself from the pain, effectively creating the reality you’re trying to avoid. Alternatively, needing solitude too often usually means there is a discrepancy between who you pretend to be and who you actually are. When you show up to your life more authentically, it becomes easier to have people around you, as it requires less effort. The way you are self-sabotaging: Automatically believing what you think and feel is true. What your subconscious mind might want you to know: You want to worry because it feels comfortable, and therefore safer. The more you blindly trust every random thought or feeling that passes through you, the more you are going to be at the whim of what’s happening around you. You must learn to steady yourself in clarity, truth, and groundedness, and to be able to mentally discern between what is helpful and what is not. The way you are self-sabotaging: Eating poorly when you don’t want to. What your subconscious mind might want you to know: You are doing too much, or you’re not giving yourself enough rest and nourishment. You are being too extreme. This is why your body is requiring that you continue to fuel it. Alternatively, it could be that you are emotionally hungry, and because you are not giving yourself the true experiences you crave, you are satisfying your “hunger” another way. — location: [880](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=880) ^ref-2497

The way you are self-sabotaging: Overworking. What your subconscious mind might want you to know: You do not have to prove your value. You do, however, have to stop running from the discomfort of being alone with your feelings, which is very often the reason that people overwork. There is a difference between being passionately committed to something and feeling obligated to outperform everyone else. One is healthy; the other is not. The way you are self-sabotaging: Caring too much about what other people think. What your subconscious mind might want you to know: You are not as happy as you think you are. The happier you are with something, the less you need other people to be. Instead of wondering whether or not someone else will think you are enough, stop and ask yourself: Is my life enough for me? How do you really feel about your life when you aren’t looking at it through the eyes of others? The — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=900) ^ref-44264

Self-sabotage is ultimately just a product of low emotional intelligence. — location: [1081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=1081) ^ref-65206

the outcomes of life are not governed by passion; they are governed by principle. — location: [1179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=1179) ^ref-45299

Making big, sweeping changes is not difficult because we are flawed, incompetent beings. It’s difficult because we are not meant to live outside of our comfort zones. If you want to change your life, you need to make tiny, nearly undetectable decisions every hour of every day until those choices are habituated. — location: [1183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=1183) ^ref-29264

Highly intelligent people have a psychological function others do not, which is the ability to infer. They can extract meaning and understanding from things that others simply take at face value. This is why people who have extremely high IQs often struggle with basic things such as social skills or driving a car. — location: [1365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=1365) ^ref-58297

Our hearts work the same way as our minds in this regard. As long as we are telling ourselves that we must let go, the more deeply we feel attached. So don’t tell yourself to let go. Instead, tell yourself that you can cry for as long as you need. That you can fall to pieces and be a mess and let your life collapse and crumble. Tell yourself that you can let your foundation fall through. — location: [1479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=1479) ^ref-34920

If you are certain that you cannot let go of what is hurting you, then don’t. — location: [1486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=1486) ^ref-11119

Often what we don’t realize is that the experiences that hurt us most aren’t usually the ones that we are indifferent about: — location: [1495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=1495) ^ref-25443

How often do we just need a partner to stop trying to strategize and just say, that must really suck? — location: [1989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=1989) ^ref-28722

When people are crying out or acting out in their lives, they aren’t just asking for help. They are most often just asking for someone to affirm that it is okay to feel the way that they do. And if they have to inflate and exaggerate circumstances for you to truly feel the weight and impact that they do? They’ll do it. They’ll do whatever it takes to get someone else to say: I am so sorry for what you are going through. — location: [1997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=1997) ^ref-5719

It’s when we can’t cry about what’s truly broken in our lives that we have a big problem. — location: [2036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=2036) ^ref-34366

Love does not make you love yourself. Relationships don’t make you good at relationships. Work doesn’t make you good at your job or capable of work/life balance. — location: [2057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=2057) ^ref-14779

The best possible version of yourself—the most loving, kind, productive, and self-aware version—is who you really are. Everything else is the byproduct of coping mechanisms you’ve developed and picked up from other people. — location: [2161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=2161) ^ref-8927

---
The pattern is often this: The person denies or ignores their true reaction to a situation or experience, believes it will simply go away if they continue to disregard it, finds that their day-to-day lives are disrupted by a sense of unease, and one day, it all comes to a breaking point and they have an emotional outburst that they cannot control. — location: [2210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=2210) ^ref-58818

Emotions are temporary, but behaviors are permanent. You are always responsible for how you choose to act. — location: [2227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B089DQRDSV&location=2227) ^ref-47010
